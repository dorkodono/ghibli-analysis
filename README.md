# Ghibli analysis
Personal project analyzing Studio Ghibli reported box office, budgets, Google Trends, and movie aggregator sites. 

**Things to do**
- Improve datasets: particularly the box office numbers, some numbers have weak sources. Particularly, *Oceans Waves*, *Only Yesterday*, *Boy and the Heron*, and *Earwig and the Witch*.
- Better organization: better title headers, organizing the data in a natural flow.
- Implement summary/abstract.
